# Universal xone Driver installation script for 

A fork of [cdleveille's](https://gist.github.com/cdleveille/e84c235c6e8c17042d35a7c0d92cdc96) script. With additional features and improvements.

- Support for most linux distros
- Added zenity for a basic "GUI"
- Added sudo check
- Added various checks to prevent the script from redoing things that are already done
- Ensure the module is loaded after install and on boot
- Return `steamos-readonly` to its previous state after install
- Allow Xbox 360 controllers by installing [xpad-noone](https://github.com/forkymcforkface/xpad-noone) which removes Xbox One support from the standard Linux `xpad` driver and allows it to coexist with `xone`
